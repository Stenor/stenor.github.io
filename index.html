				<p>The Internet and social media were never free. Companies of all sizes spend billions of dollars annually on personal <a href="http://blog.meeco.me/charlotte-and-the-digital-birth-of-her-baby-boy/" target="blank">information about you</a>. This can range from your browsing behavior to your health conditions. This data is used to <a href="http://blog.meeco.me/the-day-i-realised-my-personal-data-was-no-longer-mine/" target="blank">advertise to you</a>, grant or deny you insurance and decide whether or not you’ll get your next job.

        <p>We do not accept the premise that your information should be traded without your consent. It’s both in your and brands’ interest to partake in a mutually beneficial transaction. The way the system is broken is that you, as a citizen, are constantly targeted with advertising that’s not pertinent to your life and companies waste money to reach an audience who’s not in buying mode.</P>

        <p>This data visualization is a project by three Hyper Island Digital Data Strategy students, in collaboration with personal data platform <a href="https://meeco.me/" target="blank">Meeco</a>.</p> 

        <p>Your data changes with time and depending on developments in your life. We selected a few interesting data points in our visualization. These are already being sold on the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-what-data-brokers-know-about-you" target="blank">data brokering marketplace</a>—that’s where companies buy your personal data unbeknownst to you.</p>
        <p>We also collected Average CPL (Cost Per Lead) for specific industries. That is, how much it costs for a company to organically advertise to you and gain you as a customer. Finally, we researched how many companies are active in each specific industry.</p>
        <p>Our hypothesis is that, on a platform where brands can directly ask citizens for permission to access their data, its value becomes arbitrary. You as a owner are in charge of deciding how much you're willing to sell it for. To democratize this, we pone that a brand would have to pay you its Cost Per Lead, which is the amount of money they'd otherwise spend to turn you into a buying prospect if they were to advertise to you anyway.</p>
        <p>In our case, companies that operate within Banking / Insurance could pay you their Avg. Cost Per Lead (52$) to access such information as your age, if you have specific diseases, if you're planning on buying a house and if you've recently browsed the Internet for financial solutions.</p>
        <p>Or let's say that, if you’re in the market for buying new shoes and you express your interest for shoemaking brands to access your data, you could sell a package of your browsing information for a specific month—i.e what online stores you visited, how old you are, your email, what models you liked on Pinterest, etc.— to all the brands that request it. The brands in return, would pay you this symbolical CPL “fee”, avoiding to waste millions of marketing dollars used otherwise to entice a public who is not interested in their products.</p>
        <p>So, in our hypothesis, the value of your data could be brands' CPL compounded by the number of requests you receive.</p>

        <p><b>DV (Data Value) = BCPL (Brand Cost Per Lead) X Requests</b></p>

        <span>Introduction</span>
    </h2>

        <p>The same piece of information can be valuable for companies in specific fields, yet useless for those trading in others. We made the hypothesis that, if there was a way for you to own your data and could screen brands for access it, these would have to pay you as the owner of the data in order to know information about you.</p> <p>We averaged the number of companies in the US per industry :: (500 in Banking), (196 in Pharmaceutical), (500 in Non Profit), (153 in Real Estate), (622 in Retail ), (35 in Hardware), (131 in Software) source: Wikipedia. Data Only Applies To U.S Numbers. Numerical Values in USD (United State Dollars).</p>

 <h2>
        <span>Synopsis</span>
    </h2>
        <p>The Internet and social media were never free. Companies of all sizes spend billions of dollars annually on personal <a href="http://blog.meeco.me/charlotte-and-the-digital-birth-of-her-baby-boy/" target="blank">information about you</a>. This can range from your browsing behavior to your health conditions. This data is used to <a href="http://blog.meeco.me/the-day-i-realised-my-personal-data-was-no-longer-mine/" target="blank">advertise to you</a>, grant or deny you insurance and decide whether or not you’ll get your next job.

        <p>We do not accept the premise that your information should be traded without your consent. It’s both in your and brands’ interest to partake in a mutually beneficial transaction. The way the system is broken is that you, as a citizen, are constantly targeted with advertising that’s not pertinent to your life and companies waste money to reach an audience who’s not in buying mode.</P>

        <p>This data visualization is a project by three Hyper Island Digital Data Strategy students, in collaboration with personal data platform <a href="https://meeco.me/" target="blank">Meeco</a>.</p> 

        <p>Your data changes with time and depending on developments in your life. We selected a few interesting data points in our visualization. These are already being sold on the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-what-data-brokers-know-about-you" target="blank">data brokering marketplace</a>—that’s where companies buy your personal data unbeknownst to you.</p>
        <p>We also collected Average CPL (Cost Per Lead) for specific industries. That is, how much it costs for a company to organically advertise to you and gain you as a customer. Finally, we researched how many companies are active in each specific industry.</p>
        <p>Our hypothesis is that, on a platform where brands can directly ask citizens for permission to access their data, its value becomes arbitrary. You as a owner are in charge of deciding how much you're willing to sell it for. To democratize this, we pone that a brand would have to pay you its Cost Per Lead, which is the amount of money they'd otherwise spend to turn you into a buying prospect if they were to advertise to you anyway.</p>
        <p>In our case, companies that operate within Banking / Insurance could pay you their Avg. Cost Per Lead (52$) to access such information as your age, if you have specific diseases, if you're planning on buying a house and if you've recently browsed the Internet for financial solutions.</p>
        <p>Or let's say that, if you’re in the market for buying new shoes and you express your interest for shoemaking brands to access your data, you could sell a package of your browsing information for a specific month—i.e what online stores you visited, how old you are, your email, what models you liked on Pinterest, etc.— to all the brands that request it. The brands in return, would pay you this symbolical CPL “fee”, avoiding to waste millions of marketing dollars used otherwise to entice a public who is not interested in their products.</p>
        <p>So, in our hypothesis, the value of your data could be brands' CPL compounded by the number of requests you receive.</p>

        <p><b>DV (Data Value) = BCPL (Brand Cost Per Lead) X Requests</b></p>


        <p>We like to call this <b>“Permission Economy”</b>.</p>

        <p>This opens philosophical, ethical and financial questions that none of us can predict yet. We decided to partner with Meeco because they believe that <b>“Data Is The New Currency”</b> and its most valuable when it’s <b>“Accurate + In Context + Up-To-Date + United With Your Intent”</b>. Meeco is a service that let’s you unite your preferences and intentions—when and if you want to—with the growing demand of businesses to facilitate an open exchange that is transparent and respectful to both parties.</p>

        <p>We believe that the right to privacy is one of the most important civil rights issues of our time.</p>

        <p>Data brokers lump your information together with thousands other people’s data and sell it in list packages to companies. From these lists, companies then may build customer personas around you, email you, stalk you with advertising online and much more. Your data in these lists has an average value of 0,005$</p>

        <p>Here's a comparison of CPL per industry</p>
        <p>Banking / Insurance / Financial <b>(52$)</b> Healthcare / Pharmaceutical <b>(11$)</b> Nonprofit / Education <b>(9$)</b> Real Estate <b>(13$)</b> Retail / Consumer Goods <b>(6$)</b> Techonology [Hardware] <b>(20$)</b> Techonology [Software] <b>(29$)</b>
